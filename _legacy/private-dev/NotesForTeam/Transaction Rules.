This file contains the rules that the chaincode should contain:

1. A fee (lets say 5%) will be in action for every transaction. The fee might be different for different channels.

2. Account status or account details for an account can be modified by only the agency that owns the account.

3. Transactions older than a particular time cannot be added to the ledger. 
    example: transactions older than 30 days cannot be added to the network.
